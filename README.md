# 2024
My implementation of the popular 2048 game where you try and connect as many blocks of numbers as possible to reach the number 2048. I built it to practice responsive UI design, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript overall. The main focus was on creating a focused and minimalistic gameplay experience.

## How to Play
1. Open the game [here](https://filipek-0.github.io/2048/)
2. Use your arrow keys to move the tiles
3. Combine tiles with the same number to reach 2048
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Try it Yourself
All you need are your arrow keys and a bit of strategic thinking. Can you reach 2048?
